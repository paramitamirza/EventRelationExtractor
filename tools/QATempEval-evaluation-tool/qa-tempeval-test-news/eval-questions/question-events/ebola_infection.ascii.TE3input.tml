Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City is <EVENT eid="e1001">testing</EVENT> a patient who had recently <EVENT eid="e1002">traveled</EVENT> to a West African country affected by the Ebola outbreak, the hospital said in a statement Monday afternoon.

The male patient <EVENT eid="e1003">arrived</EVENT> at the emergency room Monday morning with a high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. He has been <EVENT eid="e1004">quarantined</EVENT> to undergo medical screening.

"All necessary steps are being taken to ensure the safety of all patients, visitors and staff. We will continue to work closely with federal, state and city health officials to address and monitor this case, keep the community informed and provide the best quality care to all of our patients," the hospital wrote in a statement.

Mount Sinai is following protocol recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <TIMEX3 tid="t1001">last week</TIMEX3>.

CDC officials told Fox News correspondent John Roberts that there have been "a half dozen or so" so-called "Persons Under <EVENT eid="e1005">Investigation</EVENT>" in the U.S. for possible Ebola infection and that they have all <EVENT eid="e1006">turned out</EVENT> to be negative.

One of those <EVENT eid="e1007">was</EVENT> at Carolina Medical Center a little more than a week ago.

The CDC <EVENT eid="e1008">assumes</EVENT> that Mount Sinai is acting out of an abundance of caution after the center <EVENT eid="e1009">sent out</EVENT> an alert regarding febrile patients who have recently traveled to West Africa.
