These tools are the compiled versions of:
https://github.com/hllorens/timeml-normalizer
https://github.com/hllorens/timeml-validator
https://github.com/hllorens/timeml-qa

You can generate them yourself cloning the code and running "mvn clean package".
The resulting jar and lib/ will be inside the generated "target/" folder.
