UPS came yesterday and left a slip stating that they attempted to deliver a package which required a signature. It said DKNY. I figured it was my watch. I left work early, too! We probably just missed them by a few minutes. Brian was saying that if he would have come home straight from work, instead of taking me to lunch, he could have been home to accept the package. Darn it. The slip did state that a second attempt would be made the following day, Friday (today). I stayed home from work even though I could not afford it, to ensure that I would be home to accept my package. They came a little earlier than stated, but I was thrilled to finally have it. I saw it in the catalog two weeks ago and just had to have it. Actually a lot of people at work are going on shopping sprees because after our call center closes on May 17th and everyone is laid off, we won't be able to avail of our 30% merchandise discount any longer.
