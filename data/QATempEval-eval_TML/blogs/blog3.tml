Mindless Mush I had a really great weekend. I got to see a lot of people I don't normally hang out with which was great. I took my mom out for Mother's Day. We went into Manhattan and saw "Movin' Out", the Billy Joel musical. It was actually really, REALLY good! Then my brother treated her and I to Ruth's Chris steaks for dinner. That was extremely yum. It was so cute because at the end of the night she started crying and thanking us for "the best mother's day ever". It was tres cute. I'm thinking of getting an apartment about 20 mins away from where I live now with my best friend from high school. I dunno how it will work out, but we're both employed full time and we've lived together before, so hopefully it wont be that bad. Plus we would have the cutest, best, most awesome apartment. Woo hoo to that. I'm also stoked because I get to do a focus group. Its like only an hour and its about facial cleansers and they're gonna pay me $50. Suhweet! She also told me she would keep me on the list and call me when she needed people. W00t, w00tarini! Oh, I also got new emo/ashleigh banfield glasses. Yay!
