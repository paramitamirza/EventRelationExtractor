Tick Tock... Well I'm pretty much all set for this Saturday's exam...at least that's how I see it... Already done my pre-exam ritual of watching a movie...Caught Kill Bill Vol.2 with Clarisse...after that the usual talk about her favorite topic...her visions of my future life with Rina... I decided to entertain her 'visions'...but then again she's the one who introduced us in the first place... So I think if we really hook up in the end then she'll see that her match-making venture did bear fruit in the end... I've one more day to go before I fully get the books out of my way... Remember I do not open my textbooks on exam eve... Maybe I'll sneak a peak tomorrow...it's Thursday...just to clarify some of the things that have yet to be fully understood... Of course I have some doubts about my study and pre-exam rituals...but then again there's always the case of the pre-exam jitters setting in... Well as I always say... Whateva Floats Your Boat...
