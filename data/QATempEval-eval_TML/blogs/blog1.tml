So i went to ikea last night. Talk about consumerism. I spent $165, and i'm sort of kicking myself. It's one of those things where you walk along and put stuff in the cart, thinking, 'oh that is a good deal' or 'i should buy this for xxx'. Then when you get to the checkout, it's $165.87 and you go 'how did that happen?' i don't know. I will admit i like to shop, but i am torn about consumerism. It's bad. and that directly conflicts with my affinity for shopping. hm. What to do? I don't know. Keep shopping? This whole website thing is my attempt to jump on the bandwagon. I'm just following suit -- many of my friends have already done this. So i feel like sort of a copy cat. But it's fun anyway. Well, i have to go check on dinner. It's cooking (and probably burning) as i write this. I set off the smoke alarm the other night. I would like to think i'm domestic, but not really. I guess domesticity takes effort which i'm not willing to make. Adieu till later.
