I told Alison this story earlier in the week and she asked me to put it up on the site. It is about a weirdo of a little boy that was coming to the education program at my work. His name, which could be the best part here, is Gockberk. He is from Turkey. And, mind you, he is not a cute Gockberk. The kid has a freakishly huge head and he NEVER stops crying. One day, I was roped into holding him after he had been crying for maybe 30 minutes. I noticed that the poor Gock was dressed in a onesie (the baby underwear that snaps down below), corduroy pants, a heavy dress shirt, and a woolen vest in an 85 degree room. He was all sweaty and uncomfortable looking, so I took off his vest. He stopped crying almost immediately. Just when I was beginning to have some fondness for his large Turkish cranium, his mom came in the room and basically bitched me out in Turkish for removing the precious vest. Well! Poor Gocky had to wear the thing for the rest of the day and pretty much cried for the remainder of the day. None of the kids like him because he never shuts up and he is the only Turkish one in the group. After that, he only came back once and I think his mom requested that I not be allowed to watch him. I just like his name. Also, there is this crazy show on the WB called urlLink The BeastMaster . Matt and I were watching it this weekend when there was nothing else on tv. It made us laugh but it was really some Tarzan-esque type of show. Check out the site -- this guy is a real hottie!
